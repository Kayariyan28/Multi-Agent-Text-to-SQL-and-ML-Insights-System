# Multi-Agent Text-to-SQL and ML Insights System (Production-Grade)

## Overview
Enhanced for industrial use with MLOps, security, and scalability. Uses LangGraph for multi-agent workflows, integrated with BigQuery/SparkML on GCP.

## Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-agent-insights.git`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (prod) and `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt` (dev)
3. Secrets: Use GCP Secret Manager or Vault; set via .env.
4. Monitoring: Set LANGCHAIN_API_KEY for LangSmith.
5. Deploy: `docker build -t multi-agent-insights .` then use k8s/ for GCP GKE.
6. CI/CD: Configured via GitHub Actions; triggers on push/PR/merge.

## Security Best Practices
- Prompt Injection: Secondary LLM guard .
- Access: GCP IAM RBAC .
- Compliance: OWASP LLM mitigations .

## MLOps
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for test/build/deploy .
- Monitoring: LangSmith for LLMs , Prometheus for metrics .
- Retraining: Scheduled via Airflow/Vertex AI .
